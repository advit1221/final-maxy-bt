Volunteer Task Manager
A streamlined Discord bot for managing volunteer tasks during hackathons and events. Built with Python, discord.py, and SQLite for persistent, high-performance task tracking.

Features

Live Task Board: A dynamic embed (/tasks) provides a real-time overview of all tasks, categorized by status.

Role-Based Permissions: Command access can be restricted to specific roles (e.g., "Organizer").

Persistent Storage: Task data is stored in an SQLite database, ensuring no data loss on bot restarts.

Optimized for Events: Designed for fast-paced environments where clear task delegation is critical.
